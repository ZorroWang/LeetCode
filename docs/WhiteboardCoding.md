# Whiteboard Coding Workflow and Best Practice

Coding interview on whiteboard is tough, and does not always find good candidates ([Max Howell interviewing at Google](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-logic-behind-Google-rejecting-Max-Howell-the-author-of-Homebrew-for-not-being-able-to-invert-a-binary-tree)). However, it is well-defined and fair method to filter out "non-qualified" engineers because of their "bad" coding skills. With more studying and practicing, we can be better on it, and getting a dream offer.
