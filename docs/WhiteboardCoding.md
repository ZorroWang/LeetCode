# Whiteboard Coding Workflow and Best Practice

Coding interview on whiteboard is tough, and does not always find good candidates ([Max Howell interviewing at Google](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-logic-behind-Google-rejecting-Max-Howell-the-author-of-Homebrew-for-not-being-able-to-invert-a-binary-tree)). However, it is a well-defined and fair method to filter out "non-qualified" engineers. With more studying and practicing, we can be better on it and getting a dream offer.

## Mindset

A coding interview is normally 45 ~ 60 mins. It is impossible to cover everything in this short period. So interviewer would usually focus on the things they mostly care. From my experience as an interviewer, there are three main parts

- How to tackle a complex technical question

- How to communicate

- Coding & testing

In general, interviewers want candidates to be solution-driven, easy to communicate and good at coding & testing. And they are willing to provide the support. So we should treat them as our colleagues and resources to help us solve the problem, instead of enemies or opponents. Some interviewers may intentionally create a stressful environment, we should keep calm in this scenario.

## Question definition and clarification

The solution of coding question is essentially defining a public API, which takes some input and returns the desired results. The list needs to be clarified is

- What the API does - the functionality of API

- What the API takes - the input of API

- What the API returns - the output of API

### What the API does

### What the API takes

### What the API returns

## Solution optimization

## Coding

## Testing

## Follow-up
