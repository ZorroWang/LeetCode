An ordered collection (also known as a sequence). The user of this interface has precise control over where in the list each element is inserted. The user can access elements by their integer index (position in the list), and search for elements in the list.

Some features in _List_ are:

- List typically allows duplicate elements.
- List typically allow multiple null elements if they allow null elements at all.
- List (like Java Array) is zero based.
- List provides the positional (indexed) access to the elements. The execution is in time proportional to the index value for some implementations.

**Note**, Vector and Stack classes basically fall in legacy classes
