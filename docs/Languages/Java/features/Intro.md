# Java Language

Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.

However, with the raise of container, the core feature of Java, WORA, has become less and less attractive. On the contrary, the language level supports (like JVM and runtime GC) make Java very heavy and slow comparing with its opponents, such as Go.
