# Enumeration

Enumeration algorithm is an algorithm that enumerates the answers to a computational problem. It usually goes through every possibility or combination to produce a list of solutions.

## Enumeration in Interviews

Enumeration usually means **brute-force** solution. It is fine to have it as initial step in an interview.
