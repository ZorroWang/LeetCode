## For Preparation

## For Interview

A coding interview is normally 45 ~ 60 mins. It is impossible to cover everything in this short period. So interviewer would usually focus on the things they mostly care. From my experience as an interviewer, there are three main parts

- How to tackle a complex technical question
  - What attitude the candidate has to solve problem and handle stress
  - How to understand technical question

- How to communicate
  - How to explain thoughts and solution
  - How to explain the blocker

- Coding & testing
  - Is the candidate a good developer
  - Does the candidate know how to test the code

In general, interviewers want candidates to be solution-driven, easy to communicate and good at coding & testing. And they are willing to provide the support. So we should treat them as our colleagues and resources to help us solve the problem, instead of enemies or opponents.

Note, some interviewers may intentionally create a stressful environment, we should always keep calm in this scenario.

### What are interviewers looking for

- No Short Answer - Do not give a short answer, just like Yes/No or BFS/DFS. Interviewers care more about how you choose the solution/technique, specially in the system design round. Give a brief explanation about all other options, pros and cons and final reason.

- Show confidence, but not elegance - Use the right words and tone to show your confidence, but not elegance. My trick is just like talking to a normal friend.

- Do not be nervous - Some interviewees are very nervous in an interview, specially fresh grad. Do more mock interviews!
