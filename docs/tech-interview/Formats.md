Interviews are a multi-stage process and each stage can consist of vastly different formats.

## Formats

### Pop Quiz

Pop quizzes are meant to be a quick and dirty way of weeding out extremely weak (or even non-technical) candidates. They are structured questions and have clear-cut answers which makes them possible to be administered by recruiters/non-technical folks. It usually come with HR or managerial interviews.

Examples:

- How to get the info of ports in Linux?
- How many strategies to do load-balancing?

### Home Assignment

There has been numerous debates on whether asking algorithm questions are a good way of assessing individual abilities as they aren't exactly the most relevant skills needed for a job. Take home assignment is a format designed to address the shortcomings of the algorithm interview by getting candidates to work on larger projects which allow them to demonstrate software design skills.

However, this interview format takes up more time from both the candidates and the company and hence it is not as commonly seen in large companies where they have a high volume of candidates. This format is more common among startups and small companies, and the assignment is close to their business.

Examples:

- Build a simulation of food delivery system
- Build a flights listing app

### Phone Screen

Phone screens are the most common format and every candidate will face this at least once while interviewing. You will be asked to speak with an interviewer either over a phone or video call. A question will be given to you and you will work on that question using an online collaborative editor (CoderPad/CodePen/Google Docs).

You are usually not allowed to execute the code even if the editor supports execution. So don't rely on that for verifying the correctness of your solution. Formats would differ slightly depending on the roles you are applying to. Many companies like to use CoderPad for collaborative code editing. CoderPad supports running of the program, so it is possible that you will be asked to fix your code such that it can be run. For front end interviews, many companies like to use CodePen, and it will be worth your time to familiarize yourself with the user interfaces of such web-based coding environments.

### Onsite Interview

If you have made it to this stage, congratulations! This is usually the final stage before an offer decision. Candidates who made it to the onsite stage will be required to have an in-person interview at the office. If you are an overseas candidate, companies might even fly you in and pay for your accommodations!

The onsite stage usually consists of multiple rounds (coding, system design, behavioral, managerial) and is expected to last for a few hours. Since you are onsite, it is possible that you will be asked to do a whiteboard exercise with an interviewer, usually either solving an algorithm question or doing a system design question. It is also possible that you have to bring your own laptops and work on a project/solve a coding problem on the spot.

For onsite interviews at smaller (non-public) companies, most will allow (and prefer) that you use your own laptop. Hence it is important that you prepare your development environment in advance.

If the company provides lunch, you might also have a lunch session with an employee where you can find out more about the company culture.

## Formats of Well-known Companies

### Airbnb

- Recruiter phone screen
- Technical phone interview:
  - 1 or 2 x algorithm/front end on CoderPad/CodePen
- On-site (General):
  - 2 x algorithm coding on CoderPad
  - 1 x system design/architecture
  - 1 x past experience/project
  - 2 x cross functional
- On-site (Front End):
  - 2 x front end coding on CodePen. Use any framework/library
  - 1 x general coding on your own laptop
  - 1 x past experience/project
  - 2 x cross functional
- Tips:
  - All sessions involve coding on your own laptop. Prepare your development environment in advance
  - You are allowed to look up APIs if you need to
  - They seem to place high emphasis on compilable, runnable code in all their coding rounds
  - Cross functional interviews will involve getting Airbnb employees from any discipline to speak with you. These interviews are mostly- non-technical but are extremely important to Airbnb because they place a high emphasis on cultural fit. Do look up the Airbnb section of the- behavioral questions to know what sort of questions to expect

### Asana

- Recruiter phone screen
- Technical phone interview
- On-site (Product Engineer):
  - 3 x algorithm on laptop. This session involves writing code on your own laptop to solve 3 well-defined algorithm problems in around 45 minutes after which an engineer will come in and review the code with you. You are not supposed to run the code while working on the problem
  - 1 x system design on whiteboard
- Tips:
  - Asana places high emphasis on System Design and makes heavy use of the whiteboard. You do not necessarily have to write code for the algorithm question of the first three interviews
  - All 4 sessions involve algorithms and system design. One of the sessions will be conducted by an Engineering Manager
  - The last session will involve coding on your own laptop. Prepare your development environment in advance
  - Regardless of Product Engineer or Engineering Generalist position, their interview format and questions are similar

### Dropbox

- Recruiter phone screen
- Technical phone interviews:
  - 2 x algorithm/front end on CoderPad/CodePen
- On-site (Front End):
  - 2 x algorithm on CodePen
  - 1 x system design on whiteboard
  - 1 x All around. Meet with an Engineering Manager and discussing past experiences and working style
- Tips:
  - You can code on your own laptop and look up APIs
  - Dropbox recruiters are very nice and will give you helpful information on what kind of questions to expect for the upcoming sessions

### Facebook

- Recruiter phone screen
- Technical phone interviews:
  - 1 or 2 x algorithm on Skype/CoderPad. They will invite you to be in their office if you are a local candidate.
- On-site (Front End):
  - 2 x Technical coding interview on whiteboard
  - 1 x Behavioural. Meet with an Engineering Manager and discussing past experiences and working style
  - 1 x Design/architecture on whiteboard
- Tips:
  - You are only allowed to use the whiteboard (or wall). No laptops involved

### Google

- Recruiter phone screen
- Technical phone interview:
  - 1 or 2 x algorithm
- On-site:
  - 4 x Algorithm on whiteboard
  - No system design or behavioral interivew
- Team matching
  - Speak with managers from different teams who are interested in your profile
- Tips:
  - In rare cases, candidates may even be allowed to skip the phone interview round and advanced to on-site directly
  - For non-fresh grads, you only receive an offer if you are successfully matched with a team
